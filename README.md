**My solutions to Codeforces problems.**

</div>

## üìñ Overview

This repository contains my solutions to various problems from Codeforces, a competitive programming platform.  The solutions are organized by problem difficulty (indicated by the folder names, e.g., "800" for problems with a difficulty rating around 800).  Each problem solution is typically contained in a separate file within its respective difficulty directory.  The solutions are primarily written in C++.  The `Explanation` directory may contain further explanations or notes for specific problems.


## ‚ú® Features

- Solutions to various Codeforces problems.
- Organized by problem difficulty rating.
- Primarily implemented in C++.
- Some problems may include explanations within the `Explanation` directory.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Language:** C++

## üöÄ Quick Start

This repository contains solutions; it is not intended to be compiled or run as a single project.  Each problem's solution is an individual program.


To access a solution:

1. **Navigate to the relevant directory:** Find the directory matching the problem's difficulty (e.g., `800`, `1300`, etc.) or contest.
2. **Locate the solution file:** Identify the `.cpp` file corresponding to the specific Codeforces problem you are interested in.
3. **Compile and run:** Use a C++ compiler (like g++) to compile the `.cpp` file and then run the resulting executable.  You may need to adjust input/output according to the Codeforces problem specifications.
